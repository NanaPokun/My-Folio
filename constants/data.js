        `I've been developing front-end applications for about 8years now. I didn't know what front-end meant at that time because I was new to development. I'm so out of content right now that I'm literally crying writing this text since lorem text is so 2012 now.`,
        `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using tailwind-css so that I don't have to style everything by myself and  for obvious reasons  if you knew tailwind, you were cool.`,
        `But now, I'm a legend. I've been coding in React, Next, Python, Django, Node.js, Express, MaterialUI, MongoDB, Bootstrap, Tailwind, PHP, Ruby, Rails and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer. I'm laughing right now.`,
